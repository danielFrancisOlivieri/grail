Before he was born, king Pelles heard a prophecy that Lancelot would concieve a child with his daughter Elaine and that child would be a boy who would grow up to be the world's greatest knight. Pelles wanted this to happen but knew that Lancelot would\
   never cheat on his mistress Guinevere. To solve this problem, he had the enchantress Dame Brusen give him a magic ring that would allow Elaine to take on the appearance of Guinevere. Using this ring, she bedded Lancelot. He was not happy when he discovered the deception. Galahad was raised by an abbess in a convent (fun fact: I once lived in a repurposed convent). Later Galahad got knighted by his father and came to Camelot. There he is pointed to a murderous chair. \
   It kills anyone who sits in it unless that person is the one who will find the Holy Grail. He sits in it and lives." >Galahad</span> who were both born with the
      same message in their throats
  Contemplating America from Long Island Sound or the Grail
      from purity is foolish, not in a bad sense but foolish as if

  The Indians who still walked around the Plains were dead and

  When he was born because his mother's womb had been so
  funny. He laughed at the feel of being a hero.

  And the Grail appeared before him like a <span title="Hand-held evice used for casting beams of light.">flashlight</span>.

  The Grail was merely a <span title="Shows grail as a destructive force eating people alive.">cannibal</span> pot
  Where some were served and some were not
  This <span title="Galahad is thought to be an allusion to the Biblical Gilead which is a region East of the Jordan river.">Galahad</span> thinks.

  The Grail was mainly the upper air
  Where men don't <span title="Iterative biological process by which reproductive fluids may be exchanged.">fuck</span> and women don't stare
  This <span Galahad thinks.

  The Grail's alive as a <span title="Starlings are small to medium-sized passerine birds in the family Sturnidae found across the world.">starling</span> at dawn
  That shatters the <span title="Third planet in solar system situated between Venus and Mars.">earth</span> with her noisy song
  This Galahad thinks.

  But the Grail is there. Like a red balloon
  It carries him with it up past the <span title="Celestial object orbiting Earth[for definition of Earth, see above].">moon</span>
  Poor Galahad thinks.

  <span title="Fluid used to deliver necessary nutrients to cells throughout the body.">Blood</span> in the stars and food on the ground
